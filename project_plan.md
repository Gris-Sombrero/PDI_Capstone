# Project Overview

	**This will be a budget tracking tool in a text based Python format.** The goal is to have it accept inputs from a CSV using positive and negative floats. In future
iterations I will seek to add some data buckets that allow me to class expenditures by different groups to better understand waste in my budget.


## User Journey

I designed my outline of expectations for feature performance in my code.


## Feature Outline

- [ ] create welcome message
- [ ] user input to chose manual budge entries or .csv upload from a directory.
- [ ] create a task by the selected budget method.
  - [ ] get all the additions
  - [ ] subtract all the negatives
  - [ ] print the sum total of funds after budget is compiled with an f string message.
  - [ ] Offer an option to export the result to a .txt file
  - [ ] Have a loop asking if the user wants to input different number sets
  - [ ] Either restart the tool at the beginning menu or close the tool depending on the answer for user.
