## User Journey

I sat down at my computer and opened up the dog api project. I wanted to see some cute pictures of dogs. I ran the program and read the welcome message. After that, the program gave me some options. I could search for a breed or just get a random image. I tried searching for a "chiuahu". The program told me that the dog breed didn't exist and suggested "chihuahua". I accepted the suggestion, and it gave me a link to click. Then it gave me the option to see another image, quit, or start over. I chose to start over. This time I chose to a random image, and saw a random dog. Finally, I chose the quit option.
